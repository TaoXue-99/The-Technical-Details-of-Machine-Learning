# The-Technical-Details-of-Machine-Learning
About all the technical details in modeling, including topics such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling and model optimization

I feel honored to be here to share some of my views and thoughts on machine learning modeling. In this respository, I'll show you some technical details and self-reflection about modeling practices that may be simple, but I think it's necessary.Here, I not only want to show more about what and how, but also pay more attention to why and my thinking, even the step by step practice process. 



我很荣幸可以在这里分享一些关于机器学习建模方面的观点和思考。
